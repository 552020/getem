# GETEM

**GETEM is a privacy-focused embedding marketplace, powered by Calimero Network and ICP.**

## Problem Statement

Increasing need for specialized and rare datasets that LLMs are not trained on to leverage specialized AI agents, while ensuring secure, decentralized data sharing to protect sensitive information.

## Target Audience

- **Buyers:** AI startups, research institutions, application makers, and enterprises needing rare and specialized datasets to provide contextual data through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
- **Sellers:** Data providers, domain experts, universities, and businesses with proprietary datasets that can be used to enhance AI models while maintaining privacy.

## Proposed Solution

GETEM is a **decentralized, privacy-preserving embedding marketplace** that enables AI models to access specialized vector embeddings securely and directly via a peer-to-peer (P2P) infrastructure. Instead of exposing raw data, data providers offer embeddings that enhance AI models' contextual understanding for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and other inference tasks.

The peer-to-peer data exchange ensures that embeddings flow securely between buyers and sellers without passing through a centralized platform. Payments are settled transparently via ICP smart contracts, guaranteeing trust and fair compensation.

## Feasibility

- **Tech-Ready:** GETEM leverages existing technologies, without requring substantial R&D efforts.
- **Key Challenges:** Streamlining the authentication process and improving developer experience (DX) on Calimero Network for fast iterations.

## Impact & Novelty

- **Riding the AI Wave:** The rapid rise and accessiblity of **autonomous AI agents** has created an unprecedented need for **specialized contextual embeddings**. GETEM addresses this demand by offering a **secure, decentralized way** to enhance AI models without exposing sensitive data.
- **Data Locality & Privacy Shift:** The release of **open-source AI models like Deep Seek** has heightened awareness of **data sovereignty and privacy**. GETEM enables **embedding retrieval without central control**, ensuring that organizations maintain full control over their intellectual property while benefiting from AI advancements.
- **New Revenue Streams for Data Owners:** By decentralizing access to embeddings, GETEM allows **data providers to monetize their knowledge assets securely**.

## Competitive Advantage (Novelty)

GETEM ensures true decentralization, enabling privacy-preserving embedding retrieval and blockchain-backed transactions without reliance on a central authority. By leveraging P2P infrastructure and ICP smart contracts, it offers a secure and transparent marketplace for embedding exchanges.

## Business Model

GETEM operates on a **transaction-based revenue model**, earning fees through:

- **Marketplace Fees:** A small percentage fee per embedding transaction.
- **Subscription Model:** Tiered access to premium embedding providers.
- **Licensing & Enterprise Integrations:** AI enterprises pay for **customized embedding solutions**.

## Roadmap

**Phase 1 – Web2 Marketplace:** P2P embedding transactions with **wallet-based payments**.
**Phase 2 – ICP Smart Contract Integration:** Automate embedding transactions using **ICP/Calimero proxy & context contract**.
**Phase 3 – Decentralization of Marketplace:** Move **frontend & marketplace** fully to ICP.
**Phase 4 – AI Agent Integration:** Enable **Federated RAG** with a special AI node, allowing private, context-aware AI execution.
